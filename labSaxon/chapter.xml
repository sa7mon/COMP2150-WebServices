	<chapter number="2" title="Chapter Two - Where I Discover the Beauty of XML">
		<p>One day, as I was walking down the road, with bits of flutter, clutter, and chaos 
		drifting off behind me, I saw a box laying in the middle of the road. Inside was all
		the neatness and orderliness of XML - everything was arranged and cosy inside those
		cute little brackets. This was the day that my life changed.
