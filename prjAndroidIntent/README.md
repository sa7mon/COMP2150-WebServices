# Project: Android Intent

## Requirements
This project will demonstrate that you can do the following:
   * Create a working Android application.
   * Build User Interface (UI) screens with buttons and input fields
   * Add Activities to the Android Manifest file.
   * Set up event listeners to trigger code when users click different buttons
   * Create an implicit intent using existing resources
   * Create an explicit intent calling a specific activity
   * Pass information from one activity to the next

The project is designed so you can demonstrate what you know and
understand about creating Android apps and using the Intent class.

You may even want to include it on your website as part of your
portfolio, showing potential employers that you know and understand
how to create a basic Android app.

## Specifications
1. **Visualize your app.**

   Create an app that will ask the user for input and then calculate a finished result.

   For example, one student created an app for her husband that allowed him to put in the dimensions of a bridge column. The app calculated the area so he knew how much concrete to order.

   Draw out the screens of your app showing the names of each UI object. Include sample data in any input fields as part of your drawing. You will be including this drawing in your video so make sure you have a digital version that you can display on your computer.

   On one of the activities include a text input field and button that will allow the user to look up information on the Web.
2. **Create a basic Android project with at least two activities**

   Name this project: prjAndroidIntent

   Create two activities/screens to gather data and show results.

   Include default information in the text input fields.

   Using Google as a resource, find a suitable images and [add them as the backgrounds to your screens](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16135984/full-screen-background-imagein-an-activity). Use images with lots of open space so the text of the app is not obscured in any way.

   Only use images that have a creative commons license.

3. **Create an intent that will take the data from one activity and use it to populate the second activity.**

   Add an intent that will take the data from the first screen/activity, do the calculations, and then send the results to be displayed on a second screen/activity.

4. **Add a textfield and button that will allow the user to display a web page on their Android device.**

   On one of the activities include a text input field and button that will allow the user to look up information on the Web. Using the appropriate Intent display the web page when the user types in a valid URL and clicks the button.

   Include a sample URL in the text input field.
