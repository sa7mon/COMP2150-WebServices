# Project: XPath

## Specifications
Build a web page named **prjXPath.html** displaying what you learned as you completed
the "Noodle With XPath" Learning Activity.

For each of the following XPath statements show a screen shot of the results. Use
thumbnails on your web page with a link to a larger image.

**Include the following 10 items:**
   1. //catalog/cd/artist/*
   2. //catalog/cd[2]
   3. //catalog/cd/title/text()
   4. What is the xpath to display the contents of the data in: artist/name
   5. //catalog/cd/@type 足 How many items show up? Why is that?
   6. //catalog/cd[@*] 足 What data is missing?
   7. //catalog/cd[@format='MAC'] 足 what doesn't show up? Why not?
   8. //catalog/cd[@format='mac']
   9. Show contents of the <year> element
   10. Show contents of year and sub足elements of artist name.

**For each XPath statement your page should show:**
   1. A screen shot showing the results. Make the screen shot as small as possible. You only need to show enough text to demonstrate what the XPath statement did. Use .gif, .jpg, or .pngs.
   2. A caption showing the xpath you used
   3. A brief statement describing what the XPath did or something that you learned from that particular XPath statement.
      * Use the XPath Lab Worksheet as the template for your web page.
      * Use a photo editor to crop the screen shots as small as possible and to make the thumbnail images.
      * The web page should be HTML valid and have zero errors.
