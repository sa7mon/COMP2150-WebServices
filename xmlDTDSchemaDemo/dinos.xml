         Though the Tyrannosaurus had many different sizes of teeth, 
         all were razor sharp and some grew to lengths of <strong>9-13 inches</strong>.
         Broken teeth were replaced frequently by newer teeth. 
         The powerful jaw exerted in excess of 3000 pounds of pressure!

         The Stegosaurus Armatus was, perhaps, the most heavily armored of all dinosaurs. 
         It is very possible though that <i></i>it was not very smart</i>, 
         it's brain is believed to have been <strong></strong>the size of a walnut!</strong>

      About the mass of a turkey this creature bounds on long legs to escape the predacious attentions of creatures such as Velociraptor. As a result of its lifestyle, this little creature has the same leggy, long-necked body-plan as any other plains-running maniraptors, from the troodonts to ostriches. - from  http://www.bowdoin.edu/~dbensen/Dinosaurs/Avimimusportentosus.html
